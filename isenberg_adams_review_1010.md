# TITLE

*The Problem of Democracy: The Presidents Adams Confront the Cult of Personality*. Nancy Isenberg, Andrew Burstein, 2019.  


# TLDR

This is a medium-interesting book that is overly long and does not fulfill its basic premise. I would not re-read it. 


# Review

I was excited to find this after really liking McCollough's biography of John Adams. 

The subtitle (*Problem of Democracy ... confront the cult of personality*) tied in with some of the interesting stories in McCoullough's book, where John Adams appears as a very down-to-earth, unflashy personality. 

For instance, how John Adams always considered himself a farmer first and foremost, even after being vice president and president. 

Or his son returning to Washington as a senator after being president.  

Plus how they both kinda failed at being president slash were one-term presidents. 

However, the book disappointed me in this regard, big time. It is a solid two-person biography of father and son, but does not develop the *Dangers of Democracy* theme much, and I found the writing style annoying. More precisely, 

1. THE BOOK IS WORDY AND OFTEN POORLY WRITTEN. I don't know how much editing this book has seen. I estimate that it could be approx. a third of its size (464 pages excl. notes) if someone had cut out some of the verbosity and repetitiveness. I personally really dislike some stylistic choices, e.g. always using a more "expressive" verb instead of *to write* or *to say*. Passages like the below are an example, but not an exception, and annoy me. 

It is taken from a description of letters between Adams and McHenry (pg 225) and I have removed some interjections that are not related to the point above. 

````
"I have heard no such conduct [...], " McHenry differed. 
"Even General Washington's Death and the Eulogisms upon him have been made us of as engines to injure and lower me [...], Sir, " Adams charged. [..] "I have read very few of the Eulogisms," said  McHenry, suggesting delusion on Adam's part. [...] "I cannot overlook your arrogant and dictatorial behavior to me," Adams upped the ante [...] Then came his giant outburst: "[...]
````

In the book, quotes are introducted by these kind of verbiage -- people are forever "blasting", writing "tentatively", "modestly", etc. 
First and foremost, I consider this terrible style. Secoind, they sometimes seem to imply a certain reading that is not very clear from the actual quitre. 

E.g. above, is McHenry really "suggesting delusion" in this quote?
To me, this is an example of *show, don't tell* -- if the author has to point out that a certain quote is "aggressive", or "upping the ante", then maybe the quote is not well-chosen to illustrate that point to begin with. 

In the other case, the additional affix is completely unnecessary as the reader will get this information from the actual quote.;

A related issue are frequent statements such as 
 the one below, concluding a paragraph describing an exchange of letters regarding the relationship between Adams and Jefferson


````
But Adams anbd Jefferson reunited? Thin threads of rumor and innuendo were woven together to form thick fabric. 

````

My beef with vague pronouncements like this are 1) that they are often unsupported by evidence 2) weird imagery and 3) really don't tell the reader much and 4) it is often unclear if they are suposed to be a summary of a passage or a finding / interpretation of the authors.

2. THE BOOK DOES NOT REALLY DESCRIBE WHAT ISSUE THE ADAMS'S SAW WITH DEMOCRACY

THis is of course the more important point than 1., but not as easy to illustrate. 

True, the authors state several times in the book that father & son Adams 1) considered political parties harmful institutions, and 2) did not approve of a cult of personality aro9und politicians, such as e.g. Andrew Jackson tried to build. 

Now 1) is a view sdjhared by most of the founding fathers. Issue 2) is mentioned frequently, but never explored. Why did they have an issue with these two items?

One answer that comes up is that they took these lessons from Greek and Roman authors they read extensively. Which kind of makes sense. However, there is no discussion of these ideas either -- it is mentioned that father & son liked to read Cicero, but the writer's impact on their political beliefs is never discussed. 

Then of course, they were also quite religious and down-to-earth farm people, at least the father Adams, who led modest lives free of scandal. However, this moral / religious background is never discussed at all. 


3. OTHER GRIEVANCES

Similarly to McCoullough's book, the authors frequently allude to both Adams being quite unpopular, and perceived as cranky old men. 

However, neither book really documents these kind of perceptions in any detail. THey also do not reallyu address how two such apparently unpopular figures managed to be voted into the presidency and other political offices successfully and consistently. 

Another unrelated  issue  is that if the Adamses indeed saw the *Problem of Democracy* defined above, what would have been their fix?

The most likely guess is that they believed in government 1) by an educated, well-to-do elite and 2) that only members of the same elite have the right to vote. 

Clearly, this is not a "solution" to any problem of democracy. 

3. WHY IS IT LIKE THIS

My personal theory for which I have no proof, in three bullet point: 

- The title of this book re the *Dangers of Democracy* fits in with the Trump presidency. He is the new Andrew Jackson, the populist leader that fooled the democratic populace and jeparodizes the US political system. 


- Thus it needed to be published soon, and review editing was not as thorough as could have been. 


- The theme was attached to what is a perfectly fine biography of two presidents, to make it more unique and give it more attnetion.
